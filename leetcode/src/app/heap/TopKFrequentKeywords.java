/**
 * Leetcode: a692.Â Top K Frequent Keywords
 * Amazon question: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/542597/
 * Additional Info: tag: heap, hash table; difficulty: medium 
 * ************************** Description:
    Given a list of reviews, a list of keywords and an integer k. Find the most popular k keywords in order of most to least frequently mentioned.

    The comparison of strings is case-insensitive.
    Multiple occurances of a keyword in a review should be considred as a single mention.
    If keywords are mentioned an equal number of times in reviews, sort alphabetically.
    Example 1:

    Input:
    k = 2
    keywords = ["anacell", "cetracular", "betacellular"]
    reviews = [
    "Anacell provides the best services in the city",
    "betacellular has awesome services",
    "Best services provided by anacell, everyone should use anacell",
    ]

    Output:
    ["anacell", "betacellular"]

    Explanation:
    "anacell" is occuring in 2 different reviews and "betacellular" is only occuring in 1 review.
    Example 2:

    Input:
    k = 2
    keywords = ["anacell", "betacellular", "cetracular", "deltacellular", "eurocell"]
    reviews = [
    "I love anacell Best services; Best services provided by anacell",
    "betacellular has great services",
    "deltacellular provides much better services than betacellular",
    "cetracular is worse than anacell",
    "Betacellular is better than deltacellular.",
    ]

    Output:
    ["betacellular", "anacell"]

    Explanation:
    "betacellular" is occuring in 3 different reviews. "anacell" and "deltacellular" are occuring in 2 reviews, but "anacell" is lexicographically smaller.
